# FacePalmGuard

This project showcases real-time pose detection and tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It incorporates three main functionalities: facial landmark detection, hand tracking, and full-body pose estimation. The application captures video from the webcam and overlays key points and connections on the detected faces, hands, and body.

## Requirements

Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before running the code:

- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sohamumap/FacePalmGuard

```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python code.py
```

Press 'q' to exit the application.

## Features

- Real-time facial landmark detection for up to two faces.
- Hand tracking with landmarks and connections displayed.
- Full-body pose estimation with annotated key points and connections.
- Display of frames per second (FPS) on the video feed.
